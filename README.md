## Description 
Me and my friend create that telegram-bot for scientific work in university.

Our main idea was to show that creating telegram-bot for business or personal needs is easy ðŸ™‚

That telegram-bot can:
1) Answer to your questions via ChatGPT on any languages, written as a text message or a voice message.
2) Generate pictures on your promt via DALL-E on RU|EN languages, written as a text message or as a voice message. Don't write: "drow me please a car", because all the words DALL-E will use to generate picture. Write promt's like: "red sport fast car in desert".

OpenAI provides free 5$ a month for using API key. It's enough to evaluate the possibilities that the bot can provide you with. If you are not satisfied with the quality of picture generation, you can use other models with API keys, like Kandinskiy or etc.

## Have a nice day!
